# React-Flask Image Processing Project

This project demonstrates a seamless integration of a React frontend with a Flask backend to enable image processing functionalities.

Key Features
Image upload and processing: Users can upload images, which are then processed by the Flask backend using OpenCV.
Grayscale conversion: The current implementation converts uploaded images to grayscale as an example of image processing.
Clean frontend and backend separation: The frontend and backend are clearly separated, promoting modularity and maintainability.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): CORS is enabled to allow communication between the React frontend and Flask backend running on different ports.
